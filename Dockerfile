# Single-VM deploy for Fly.io: builds all 3 workspace apps, runs all 3 as
# separate processes in one container (see docker-entrypoint.sh). Only the
# backend's port is exposed publicly; it proxies /liff and /admin to the
# other two internally (apps/backend/src/main.ts), matching how local dev
# shares a single tunnel origin today — no CORS, no separate domains.
